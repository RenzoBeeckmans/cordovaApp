    <p id="intro">Welcome to the website for my Ski Tracker application. I made this app to record skiing sessions and keep track of some data
    while doing so. The first page is an info page about the app and myself. The second page is where the magic happens,
    This is where you make your recordings and see some data. There's still some error in there which makes that we have to
    disable and enable our location services again before it refreshes the live data on the display. <br>
    The third page is where you can see some statistics about previous recordings to see how you've done in the past.
     There is also an option to delete all of that data. <br>
    Unfortunately I didn't get my fourth page to work in time so that will not be available. The plan was for that page to
    become a weather forecast.</p>

    <p class="title">Introduction and features</p>
    <p id="intro">Welcome to the website for my Football Tracker application. I made this app to have an easier way of checking in
        on a couple of Europe's top football leagues. The first page is an info page about the app and me. The second page is where the magic happens,
    This is where you can choose one of the 5 leagues listed and the current season's league table will generate.
        The statistics used come from ESPN and should be updated regularly during the season.<br>
    The third page is where you can prepare a text message to send to your friends, it does not have to be football related of course,
         when ready, you can press the button and the message and number will be exported to your phone's SMS app.<br>
    The fourth page is where you can save your favourite league so that next time you open the app, that league table automatically loads
     without having to choose it again.</p>
